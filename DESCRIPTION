Description: The ToppGene Suite is a one-stop portal for gene list enrichment
    analysis and candidate gene prioritization based on functional annotations
    and protein interactions network.  Although the ToppCluster web application
    provides convenient graphical access to the ToppGene Suite, the OpenAPI 3.0
    compliant interface of ToppGene is better suited for automation.  This
    package was initial generated from OpenAPI Generator and supplemented with
    Bioconductor class interfaces and more relevant biological examples.
