Description: The ToppGene Suite is a one-stop portal for gene list enrichment
    analysis and candidate gene prioritization based on functional annotations
    and protein interactions network.  Although the ToppCluster web application
    provides convenient graphical access to the ToppGene Suite, the OpenAPI 3.0
    compliant interface of ToppGene is better suited for automation and
    reproducibility.  This package includes Bioconductor class interfaces and
    biological examples.
